This project is part of my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. It involves analyzing sales data from a commercial store to uncover key insights about the business. Using Python, I processed and visualized data to explore trends in sales, top-performing products, regional performance, and category-wise revenue.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python (for data manipulation and analysis)

pandas (for data handling)

matplotlib and seaborn (for data visualization)

Total Sales by Category
Visualized the total sales across different product categories to identify top-performing segments.

Monthly Sales Trends
Plotted the sales trend over time to assess monthly performance and seasonality.

Top 10 Products by Sales
Analyzed and visualized the top 10 products contributing the most to overall sales.

Regional Sales Performance
Analyzed how sales perform across different regions to identify potential areas of improvement.
