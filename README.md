# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
This project is part of my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. It involves sales data analysis of a commercial store using Python. I explored trends in sales, top-performing products, regional performance, and category-wise revenue using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
